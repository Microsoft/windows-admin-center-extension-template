# Windows Admin Center CLI #

The Windows Admin Center CLI was created to simplify the process of generating new tools for the platform.

## Usage ##

There is only one command for the CLI, "Create".  In order to create a new tool, type the following:

```
wac create --company <Your Company Name> --tool<Your Tool Name>
```
For instance, when creating a tool called Foo for Microsoft, my command would be:

```
wac create --company Microsoft --tool Foo
```

You can also use the CLI to create solution extensions as well:

```
wac create --company Microsoft --tool Foo --solution MySolution
```

In addition to creating extensions, you can specify which version of the SDK you want to utilize.  There are 3 rings for you to choose from:

* latest (the most current GA release, 2 updates per year)
* insider (build most recently released to Insiders.  Updates monthly)
* next (current dev build.  Updates frequently, up to weekly)

In order to specify which SDK version you want to use, add the version tag to the create command:

```
wac create --company Microsoft --tool Foo --version insider
```

Default value is latest.
