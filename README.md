# Windows Admin Center CLI #

The Windows Admin Center CLI was created to simplify the process of generating new tools for the platform.

## Usage ##

There is only one command for the CLI, "Create".  In order to create a new tool, type the following:

```
wac create --company <Your Company Name> --tool<Your Tool Name>
```
For instance, when creating a tool called Foo for Microsoft, my command would be:

```
wac create --company Microsoft --tool Foo
```
